# Requirement Analysis in Software Development
Requirement Analysis is a crucial phase in the software development lifecycle. It involves defining, documenting, and analyzing user expectations for a new or modified software product.This project simulates a real-world development scenario, emphasizing clarity, precision, and structure in defining requirements to set the stage for successful project execution.

## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) where the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirements of the software product to be developed. This process ensures that all stakeholders have a clear and mutual understanding of what the system should do and how it should perform.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
#### 1.Clear Vision: Ensures that the development team has a clear understanding of what the software should do.
#### 2.Efficient Development: Prevents costly rework by identifying and addressing potential issues early on.   
#### 3.Quality Assurance: Helps to deliver a product that meets the specific needs and expectations of the users.   
#### 4.Risk Mitigation: Reduces the risk of project failure by minimizing misunderstandings and scope creep.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
### 1. Requirement Gathering: Requirement gathering is the initial and crucial phase of any software development project. It involves identifying, documenting, and analyzing the specific needs and expectations of the end-users and stakeholders for the software product
### 2. Requirement Elicitation Requirement elicitation is the process of identifying, documenting, and analyzing the specific needs and expectations of the end-users and stakeholders for a software product. It's the first and most crucial step in the software development lifecycle.
### 3. Requirement Documentation: 
### 4.Requirement Analysis and Modeling
### 5.Requirement Validation.
