# Requirement Analysis in Software Development
Requirement Analysis is a crucial phase in the software development lifecycle. It involves defining, documenting, and analyzing user expectations for a new or modified software product.This project simulates a real-world development scenario, emphasizing clarity, precision, and structure in defining requirements to set the stage for successful project execution.

## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) where the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirements of the software product to be developed. This process ensures that all stakeholders have a clear and mutual understanding of what the system should do and how it should perform.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
#### 1.Clear Vision: Ensures that the development team has a clear understanding of what the software should do.
#### 2.Efficient Development: Prevents costly rework by identifying and addressing potential issues early on.   
#### 3.Quality Assurance: Helps to deliver a product that meets the specific needs and expectations of the users.   
#### 4.Risk Mitigation: Reduces the risk of project failure by minimizing misunderstandings and scope creep.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
### 1. Requirement Gathering: Requirement gathering is the initial and crucial phase of any software development project. It involves identifying, documenting, and analyzing the specific needs and expectations of the end-users and stakeholders for the software product
### 2. Requirement Elicitation Requirement elicitation is the process of identifying, documenting, and analyzing the specific needs and expectations of the end-users and stakeholders for a software product. It's the first and most crucial step in the software development lifecycle.
### 3. Requirement Documentation: Requirement documentation is the process of creating detailed, unambiguous, and verifiable specifications for a software product. It serves as a blueprint for the development team, ensuring that the final product meets the needs and expectations of the stakeholders.
### 4.Requirement Analysis and Modeling: Requirement analysis and modeling is a crucial phase in the software development lifecycle. It involves understanding, documenting, and visualizing the functional and non-functional requirements of a software system.
### 5.Requirement Validation: Requirement validation is a critical step in the software development lifecycle, ensuring that the elicited and documented requirements accurately reflect the needs and expectations of the stakeholders. It helps to identify and rectify errors, inconsistencies, and ambiguities in the requirements before the development phase begins.

## Types of Requirements
### Functional Requirement:
#### 1. Hotel Management Service:
Hotel managers can add, update, and delete hotel information (e.g., name, location, description, amenities, photos).
Hotel managers can set room availability and pricing.
Hotel managers can manage booking requests.
#### 2. Customer Service:
Users can search for hotels based on various criteria (e.g., location, date, price, amenities).
Users can view details of available hotels (e.g., description, photos, amenities).
Users can book a hotel room.
Users can cancel or modify an existing booking.
#### 3. View Booking Service:
Users can view all their current and past booking details (e.g., hotel name, dates, room type, price).
### Non-Functional Requirement:
#### 1. Performance:
The system should be able to handle a high volume of requests efficiently.
The search results should be displayed quickly.
The booking process should be fast and easy to complete.
#### 2. Scalability:
The system should be able to scale to accommodate a growing number of users and hotels.
#### 3. Security:
The system must be secure against unauthorized access and data breaches.
User's personal information and payment details must be encrypted.
#### 4. Availability:
The system should be available 24/7 with minimal downtime.
#### 5. Usability:
The system should be easy to use for both hotel managers and customers.
The user interface should be intuitive and user-friendly.


## Use Case Diagrams
A use case diagram is a visual representation of the interactions between users and a system. It provides a high-level overview of the system's functionality and helps to identify the key features and scenarios.
